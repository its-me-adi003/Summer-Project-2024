Thereafter it joins -
the Ghaggar

stream dries up near Sirsa.
Beyond that
it is only the dry bed that is identifiable,

through Rajasthan, Cholistan and Sindh
down to the Rann of Kachchha. as already
mentioned earlier.
A question may well be asked: Since
as of now the Sarasyati-Ghaggar combine
does not carry plenty of water and dries
up beyond a certain point. how come that
the dry bed is so wide, sometimes, as
already stated. up to 8 km? In search of
the answer. we have once again to get
back to the Rigueda.
Verse RV 6.61.2
states:

From where did the Sarasvati g
paripataghnmavase supriktibhih its water:


This
(Sarasvati
river)
has
shattered the mountain peaks with
her fast and powerful waves, just (as
easily) as one uproots the lotus stems;
let us invoke her. who strikes what is
far and near. with holy hymns and
prayers.

Again. RV 6.61.8 endorses that: yasy

amaicharatt. ronuvat / /

Whose

Sarasvati)
boundless. impetuous and swift-moving
Nood gushes forth with tempestuous
roar.

From the foregoing it would be
abundantly clear
that
the
Rigvedic
Sarasvati had plenty of water in it. so
much so that its fast and powerful
currents could sometimes even shatter
the peaks of mountains.
That this river flowed all the wav down

That this river llowed al the way down
to the sea is also duly vouchsafed by the

Purest amongst all the rivers and
vibrant. the Sarasvati moves on from the
mountains to the ocean (cf. Figs. 2.3 and
2.2).

It may also be pointed out that the
Parchavinsa Brahmana (XXXV.10.16)
refers to the drying up of the Sarasvati,
Thus. the literary data fully corroborate
the presence of tremendous amount of
water in the Sarasvati river in ancient

water-supply to the Sarasvati? In this
connection many suggestions have been
made, one of which s that the Yamuna

the Sarasvati and hence the Inordinate

However. not all scholars accept this
proposition.

objections.
The
most
significant of these is the fact that the
Yamuna has well developed terraces in
ts upper reaches. which shows that its
present course is very ancient. dating
back to the Pleistocene limes or at the

This would
