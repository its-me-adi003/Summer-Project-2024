objections.
The
most
significant of these is the fact that the
Yamuna has well developed terraces in
ts upper reaches. which shows that its
present course is very ancient. dating
back to the Pleistocene limes or at the
latest to the Early Holocene.
This would
not support the view that the Yamuna
lowed via the Drisadvati in the fourth
millennium BCE - Lime of the Early and
