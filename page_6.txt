recent environmental change has come
up because of the canal that has been
laid out in the dry bed of the Ghaggar
(Sarasvati). Likewise, one can well imagine
that during the Harappan times when the
mighty Sarasvati itself was flowing past
the site the environment must have been
no less green. Indeed, the discovery of a
ploughed field with criss-cross furrow
marks, ascribable to the Early Harappan
times,? fully endorses such a view.

sites excavated on the Indian side of the
border after Independence. As would be
seen a little later, it has made some very
valuable contributions to our knowledge

known as the Indus/Indur-Saranvat
Civilization). The site is about 6 km south

not be out of place here to recall some of

remember all that; and perhaps some of

mounds (Fig- 4.1). of these, the one in
the middle (called KLB-2) is the largest,
though it has been badly eroded on the
southern side. It measures approximately
240m east-west and seems to have been
not less than 360m north-south. That on
the west (called KLB-1) measures roughly
240m north-south and 120m east-west.
As would have been observed, the longer
axis in both the cases is north-south, i.e.
almost at right angles to the adjacent
river, which is somewhat unusual, since
normally habitations stretch along the
river. Anyway. both the mounds rise to a
height of approximately 10m above the
surrounding plains. The third mound,
named KLB-3, is a bit away to the east of
KLB-2 and is very much smaller in area.
approximately 70m X 50m, and only 2.5m
in height. The reason for this small size
of the last-named mound lies in the fact
that it was not a residential complex but
was used only for a limited (ritualistic)
purpose.
