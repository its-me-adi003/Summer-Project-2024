From the foregoing it would be
seen that during the Rigvedic times there
flowed a river called the Sarasvati,
between the Yamuna and the Sutlej. And
even today there flows a river called the
Sarasuti (-Sanskrit Sarasvati) between
the aforesaid two rivers.It now originates
at the foot of the Siwalik hillls and flows
in a southwesterly direction in Haryana,
passing by Pipli,
Kurukshetra
and

o Sindhu (Indus), flowing. you first
meet the Tristima (and then) the Susartu,
he Rasa, and the Sveta (Swat). and
hereafter the Kubha (Kabul), the Gomati
Gomal), the Krumu (Kurram) with the
Mehatnu; and (finally) you move on in
he same chariot with them (i.e. carry
heir waters with you). [6]

ancient
site
of Kalibangan
stands on the left bank
of a river
which is now dry, though its bed is
about 5 kilometres wide at this point
and has been measured even up to 8
km in width elsewhere (ef. Fig. 2.1).
Its present name in the Kalibangan
region is the Ghaggar but downstream
in Cholistan (Pakistan) it is known as
the Hakra. Still further down, in Sindh,
it goes by yet different names, such as
the Raini, Wahinda and Nara. There is
geomorphological evidence to show that
the
river
fell
into
the
Rann
of
Kachchha, an arm of the Arabian Sea
(Fig. 2.2). However, it is very difficult
to find out why and when this same
river
was
given
these
altogether
different names in the various regions.
And more important is the question:
What was its name when it was flowing
and was the life-line of the Early and
Mature
Harappan
people
whose
settlements. dating back to at least the
fourth millennium BCE, prospered all

Perhaps we have to get back to
ancient Indian literature in search of the
