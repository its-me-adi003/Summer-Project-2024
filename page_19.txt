Block Type 0:
1) Group E: Well The platform which is
situated in trench YA-4 has a well of baked
wedge-shaped bricks laid horizontally. It
is sealed by layer 5. The width of the ring
of the well is 30 a. and supported by four
radial walls having a width of27 cm. The
inner diameter of the well is 1.25 m and
outer diameter is 1.85 m.
It appears that
at the outset of the buildings the well a
huge foundation was
dug
and these
supporting radial walls were constructed
to give further strength to the wall.
The
well had 86 available exposed courses and
so the radial walls but the bricks have been
robbed. This
has
been an unusual
construction. It appears that after the
construction of the radial walls the in
between space was flled up gradually with
the gaining of additional height during the

in
Indian
Archaeology - when not exposed fully),
The longer axis being along east-west.
Its
three
angles
along
could
be
recovered, the 4" viz. north-western,
having been eroded away. The platform
has two structural phases.
The width
of the passage running between this
platform and other lying to the south,
was found to be 10 m.
In its earlier
phase part of the passage was seen to
be paved with mud bricks. On the
extent the platform obviously belonging
to the upper levels of occupation was
found.

These platiorms werc built in wo
phases. One first phase was built on layer
18, Layers 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12 and 10
are contemporary and layer 9 seals it.
The latter platforms are built on layer 8.
Layers 7,6,5 and 4 are contemporary
and layer 3 seals it (see section looking

There were no residential buildings
in this arca.
The platforms are marked
as A, B,C, - D,E, and F in the plan. The
