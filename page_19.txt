1) Group E: Well The platform which is
situated in trench YA-4 has a well of baked
wedge-shaped bricks laid horizontally. It
is sealed by layer 5. The width of the ring
of the well is 30 a. and supported by four
radial walls having a width of27 cm. The
inner diameter of the well is 1.25 m and
outer diameter is 1.85 m.
It appears that
at the outset of the buildings the well a
huge foundation was
dug
and these
supporting radial walls were constructed
to give further strength to the wall.
The
well had 86 available exposed courses and
so the radial walls but the bricks have been
robbed. This
has
been an unusual
construction. It appears that after the
construction of the radial walls the in
between space was flled up gradually with
the gaining of additional height during the
