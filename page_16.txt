had already indicated the existence of
the fortification wall on the northern
side of the northern half, which was
thus shown to be similarly enclosed as
the southern half. The entire length of
the fortification wall on the northern
side,
including
the
north-western
corner bastion, was exposed, the details
of the north-eastern corner, being
insufficiently preserved, remaining
undetermined. The wal was found to
run parallel to the partition-wall up to
a length of about 85 m from the eastern

Despite patient search, no traces of
the fortification-wall have been found on
the western side beyond the tum of the
comer tower.
It may be recalled that no
tuming or re-entrant of the fortification
was noticed at the south-western comer
as well.
The western side of the mound
is badly riven by lood-water and modern
depredations.
It is likely. therefore, that
all vestiges of the fortification-wall on this
side have been completely lost due to
erosion.

on the western side, however, rurther
attempts to trace the outline of the
Harappan fortification wall, further west of
the already-trenched area, revealed the
existence of an Early Harappan fortification-
wall. While exposing its full width, typical

On the southern side, the Early
Harappan (Period I) fortification wall was
exposed to a length of about 35 m. from
the south-western end, beyond which
distance it was found to be cut for the
foundations of the Harappan fortification
wall entrance complex and the sallent.
The outside face of this wal seems to
have originally been plastered with mud,
patches of which were still found at
places.

Harappan bricks (size: 40x20x10 cm.) were
found well laid on the outer side indicating
that the Harappans had used the existing
Early Harappan fortification-wall on this side
for raising their ditadel-fortification. At some
places, the eroded face of the existing Early
Harappan fortification-wall, up to the height
it was exposed, scems to have been
reinforced by the Harappans by some sort of
a mud-brick revetment.
Whereas the
alignment of the outer face of the Harappan
fortification wall on this side, based at some
places on the bottom course alone, could
thus be recovered, its inner face and
consequently its original width, being
insufficiently preserved, remained unknown.
However the remains of the fortification in
its eroded and reinforced position is about
21 m in the basal stage.

in the central part of its length, showed
a battered angle both on the exterior and
the interior faces,
the
taper being
obtained by thick coating of mud plaster.
At the extant highest point, the wall was
found to stand to a height of 3.40 m., with
its outer face (in the earlier phase)
battered back to an angle of 34Â°. The
thickness of the wal was available at a
couple of places, it still requires to be
properly determined, keeping in view the
projections and the salient
(Figs. 5.12
and 5.12(a)). The western end of this wall
is incompletely preserved, both its inner
and
outer
angles
being
absent.
Nevertheless, at the north-western turn,
remains of an impressive structure.
perhaps part of a corner-tower with a
battered exterior were brought to light.
This construction is in the nature of a
reinforcement to an earlier damaged or
eroded structure and both by the size of
the bricks used and by the stratigraphic
evidence, belonged to the second phase
of the fortification-wall
